      <p>You are not going to see a webstore here where you can just add to cart and check out. We’re not building thousands of pedals. Our products are built in runs of 6 to 50 units or custom build for an individual person. Most are sold in person at Full Custom Music Repair. At this time we do not list our products on Ebay, Reverb, or any other online platform. We feel that small independent music stores that deal directly with the public are where our products sell the best. However we will still sell and ship to a retail customer through Full Custom Music Repair if you message us privately.</p>
      <p>Also we are available for consulting, engineering, and product testing. Lately we have been helping to maintain a late mid century commuter rail HVAC system through the design and fabrication of replacement control modules.</p>

      <div class="fakeimg"><img src="_img/cardigan.jpg" alt="cardigan" class="img"></div>
      <p>New Version Currently in Build.</p>
      <p>Cardigan is our platform for building small format tube preamps. The Cardigan is the same size as some of our other pedals and will run on any center tip negative 9~12 Volt supply that can supply at least 400mA. Despite these limitations the audio circuit is supplied with 100 Volts that is made by the pedal's internal DC to DC converter.</p>

      <h2>Pineapple</h2>
      <h5>Last Updated, Dec 3, 2020</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg"><img src="_img/pineapple.jpg" alt="pineapple" class="img"></div>
      <p>The challenges of 2020 demanded a ruder, nastier fuzz that I could sell at a lower price point. My Pandemic personal project brought forth the Pineapple. A BC108 Silicon Fuzz with a boosted output and bias control.</p>

      <h2>Starfish Mini</h2>
      <h5>Last Updated, Oct 25, 2021</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg"><img src="_img/starfish.jpg" alt="starfish" class="img"></div>
      <p>Returning Soon, Check Dealers for stock.</p>
      <p>The current Starfish is actually the Starfish Mini. This version only has two controls because we removed the active EQ to fit the circuit into the same enclosure as the Pineapple. Starfish is a Scrambler. I designed the Starfish as a simpler alternative to my Dr p0rn CMOS ring modulator. The future may bring weirder and more wonderful versions of the Starfish.</p>

      <div class="fakeimg"><img src="_img/mr_toad.jpg" alt="Mr Toad" class="img"></div>
      <p>Hopefully Returning in 2022</p>
      <p>Mr Toad was built as a limited over-run during Starfish/Pineapple production. It is simply those two pedals in one enclosure. We are hoping to bring Mr Toad back into production at some point soon.</p>
