[First-run Original Barnacle Fuzz on Reverb](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=67144&awinaffid=2579497&ued=https%3A%2F%2Freverb.com%2Fitem%2F92219419-full-custom-music-barnacle-fuzz-pedal-2010-s-ted)

Above is a link to a Reverb listing of a first-run Barnacle, produced under my original trademark. This is the first time I've seen one listed for more than its original sale price. Could it be an early sign that my older designs will become collectible?

Out of all my pedals the Barnacle is the one that I made in the largest number. Most were made in 2011 and 2012. 100 of the classic red were made but only the first two years have Full Custom Music printed on them. Two very special ones were made; a hand painted one for Sigur RÃ³s, and a Meme-top version that ended up with Monolord. Branded as the Dallas Fuzz, with a picture of Larry Hagman as the graphic. It can be heard on their album, Rust. 

The Meme-top series was sold on eBay with a starting price of $1 and no reserve bid. This was around the time of my trademark dispute. Most sold with a final price of around $40. 

In 2022 the last 12 Barnacle boards were used to build the Narwhal Industries Barnacle V, a modified version with a fifth switchable bias control to engage Pineapple mode. This used up the last of the original PC boards and marked a firm end to production. If I ever bring the Barnacle Fuzz back it will likely be an entirely new design based on the original. As the classic red and white Barnacle used a transistor series that is now obsolete.
